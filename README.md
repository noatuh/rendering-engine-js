# 3D & 4D Rendering Engine Demo

This project is a minimal JavaScript rendering engine for visualizing geometric objects in 0D, 1D, 2D, 3D, and 4D:

- **Point (0D)**
- **Line (1D)**
- **Square (2D)**
- **Cube (3D)**
- **Tesseract (4D hypercube)**

## Features
- Interactive rotation: Click and drag to rotate objects in 3D.
- Zoom controls: Use the slider or buttons to change object size.
- Play/Pause: Toggle automatic rotation animation.
- Shape selector: Instantly switch between point, line, square, cube, and tesseract.
- Responsive design: Canvas resizes to fit your window.

## Usage
1. Open `index.html` in your browser.
2. Use the controls at the top left to select a shape, zoom, and rotate.
3. For 3D and 4D objects, drag the mouse to rotate in space.

## Technologies
- HTML5 Canvas
- Vanilla JavaScript
